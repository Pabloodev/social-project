        Founded in 2005, our organization began with a simple mission: to
        provide educational opportunities to children in underserved
        communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        What started as a small initiative with just five volunteers has now
        grown into a global movement with hundreds of dedicated team members
        across 25 countries.

        Throughout our journey, we've remained committed to our core values of
        inclusivity, sustainability, and empowerment. These principles guide
        every project we undertake and every decision we make.
